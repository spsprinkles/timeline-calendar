The Timeline Calendar web part can pull in data from multiple sources and render them together in a dynamic, filterable timeline view. This includes **SharePoint** lists (and "classic" calendars) as well as **Outlook** calendars (including **Microsoft 365 Group** calendars). Options are available to easily adjust how the timeline behaves, including configuring the tooltip, and there is support for making advanced configuration changes to refine the look and behavior of the timeline.
